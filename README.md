## Deploying for development purposes
- Ensure you have docker and docker compose installed. (`docker version` and `docker compose version` commands return meaningful responses)
- In the root directory of the codebase (where docker-compose.yml located), run `docker compose up -d`
- Check the following url until it returns a successful response: http://localhost:8080/api/authentication/stats
